## About Project

WPGens WordPress React Admin Panel was built to modernize the building and the look of WordPress plugins administration panel. Instead of using Settings API, we are communicating with the backend through REST API, allowing the use of modern technologies. @wordpress/api-fetch also simplified the flow.

### Project Stack

WPGens WordPress React Admin Panel is written in **TypeScript**. **React hook form** is used for settings panel forms, **@wordpress/api-fetch** to securily communicate with WordPress backend. **TailWind CSS** for styling (easy to start with, just set up your IDE), **React Query** optimizes data management by efficiently handling fetched data, reducing the need for extensive manual state management, **yup** is used for form validation to ensure data integrity before submission. We are also using **vite** instead of webpack to build the app and serve the HMR. The only UI libraries are **React Select** and **React Color**. We can add more libraries but the goal is to keep it light and simple.
